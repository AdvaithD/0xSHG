# Proffer Network Hackathon
This repository contains the source code for the rural microfinance project and the corresponding web interface.
## What's going on here?
blockchains aren't just a way of checking validity of transactions in distributed way, they're also novel methods of organising societies.
Rural microfinance problems aren't just financial, but also.

Microfinance institutions are essential to economic sustenance of rural finance and small businesses. Initiatives like Self Help Groups (SHGs) depend on the fact that when villagers pool money, peer-pressure reduces defaulter risk, get loans from banks with flat interest rates.

### What we built?
We propose a simple model, where villagers all across India can pool their resources and receive interest-free microloans from the network. Blockchain technology enables micro-transactions (which allows for a greater inclusion for poverty-stricken individuals), automatic bookkeeping (no delay or pathy maintenance of ledgers) in a transparent (all transactions are open) manner. We remove the need for a central managing authority by using a smart contract. By needing consent from previous members to enter the network and making them accountable for him, we introduce peer pressure into the network. This lowers chances of non-repayment of loans (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_lending).

Using these elements, we can create an Aadhar-linked digital pan-Indian SHG network. In this network, MAXIMUM POSSIBLE microloan requests are fully funded with 0% interest (least request satisfied first) and the reserve wealth is re-distributed into the system. People can exit the network by requesting their deposited money, which theyâ€™ll receive in the next bidding when the loans are repayed.

#### Scheme
Every 3 months, all loan-requests in the network are collected and the maximum possible loan requests are fulfilled.
Every person who receives a loan has 3 months (until next bidding) to pay back his loan. Failure to do so will mean 4 people accountable for that person will have to bear the loan.

#### Three steps to zero-interest loans:
Get validated
Deposit money
Request microloan

#### Peer Pressure on the blockchain
Solidarity lending (peer pressure and mutual accountability to repaying loans) is an building block of rural microfinance. But in a pan-India digital network, this peer-pressure would be minimised. We achieve peer-pressure on a peer-to-peer network by using a novel innovative accountability solution, as described below.
A new member on the network can only be added once his Aadhar identity been physically validated by 4 pre-existing nodes on the network. If the person defaults, the four people responsibility for him are required to split his debt. This roots the digital network in physical space, and simulates the same social pressure necessary solidarity lending groups.
